            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto"> Technology course in Digital Games at Unisinos, located in the city of São Leopoldo in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.
                 At Unisinos was where I had my first contact with programming, where I learned to program using C++ with graphic libraries like OpenGL. Furthermore, the course teaches you in depth how to use the Unity game engine, programming in C#.
                 During the course I also learned in a more superficial way how to develop games using Python
            </p>

            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto"> Professionally, I worked using Unity to develop an application that aims to sell glasses and similar products over the internet.
                I also worked on an internship where the objective was to develop native applications for iOS, using Swift. In this opportunity I learned deeply about technology and worked with the company on some clients.
                Today I'm working as an intern at the company Vortigo, here I'm learning how to develop both the backend and frontend of hybrid applications. </p>
